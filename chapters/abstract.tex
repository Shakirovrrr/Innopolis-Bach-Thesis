In this work, we present two methods for processing point clouds for rendering acceleration. The first method generates different levels of detail for parts of the cloud to simplify the parts of the point cloud that are barely visible. The second method reconstructs the terrain model mesh that has a smaller size and fewer vertices. As we were working on automotive simulator software, we needed to visualize terrain scans captured in the form of point clouds. Rendering unprocessed point cloud data has a significant performance impact. Thus, we decided to optimize the way we visualize point clouds. In this work, we propose two methods that we implemented as a proof of concept. The results revealed a noticeable performance improvement, so we successfully integrated these methods into the automotive simulator. Furthermore, we found ways to visualize point clouds with high performance while maintaining the visual quality on the same level as unprocessed data. Furthermore, developers who work on terrain visualizing software, vehicle simulators, and other visualization applications could consider this work for applying it in their product.
